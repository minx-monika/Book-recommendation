# Book Recommendation System

This project is a **Book Recommender System** built using machine learning algorithms to recommend books based on user preferences.

## Features
- **Content-based Filtering**: Recommends books based on user ratings and preferences.
- **User Interface**: A simple web-based interface to interact with the recommender system.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trains on book data to predict relevant book recommendations.


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `flask`, etc.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- Git
- Jupyter Notebooks (for model development)

## Future Improvements
- Integrate collaborative filtering for better recommendations.
- Enhance the user interface with more interactive features.
- Deploy the system using cloud services like AWS or Heroku.
- Optimize the recommendation algorithm for faster processing.
